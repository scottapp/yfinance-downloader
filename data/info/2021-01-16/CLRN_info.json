  "longBusinessSummary": "Clarent Corporation develops software-based communications solutions through Internet Protocol (IP) communications networks. Its software-based solutions are designed to enable service providers to deliver simultaneous transmission of voice, fax, and data over IP networks. The company's solutions provide bridges between the traditional circuit-switched telephone system and Internet protocol networks, allowing the use of IP telephony to be transparent to end user customers using their existing wire line or wireless telephones. The company serves service providers, system integrators, resellers, and enterprises. Clarent Corporation was formerly known as NetiPhone and changed its name to Clarent Corporation in May 1997. The company was incorporated in 1996 and is based in Redwood City, California with additional offices in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. On December 13, 2002, Clarent Corporation filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. The plan was later approved as Chapter 11 liquidation on April 1, 2004. Clarent Corporation is in liquidation.",
