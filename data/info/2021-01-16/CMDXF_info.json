  "longBusinessSummary": "Computer Modelling Group Ltd., a computer software technology company, develops and licenses reservoir simulation software in Canada. The company offers CMOST AI, an intelligent optimization and analysis tool that offers solution for its reservoir by combining statistical analysis, machine learning, and non-biased data interpretation; IMEX, a black oil simulator that is used to model primary and secondary oil recovery processes in conventional and unconventional oil/gas reservoirs; GEM, an equation-of-state reservoir simulator for compositional, chemical, and unconventional reservoir modelling; STARS, a thermal and processes reservoir simulator for the modelling of steam, solvents, air, and chemical recovery processes; and CoFlow, a reservoir and production system modelling software that allows reservoir and production engineers to make informed decisions on large integrated oil and gas projects. It also provides Builder, a pre-processor that simplifies the creation of simulation models by providing a framework for data integration and workflow management between various data sources; Results, a post-processor that helps in enhancing understanding and insight into recovery processes and reservoir performance; WinProp, a fluid property characterization tool; and Autotune artificial intelligence solutions that tune the model for optimal run time.In addition, the company provides professional services comprising specialized support, consulting, training, and contract research services. It sells its products and services in approximately 60 countries. Computer Modelling Group Ltd. was founded in 1978 and is headquartered in Calgary, Canada.",
