It specializes in hydrogen production and hydrogen related products. The company developed proprietary technologies to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, as well as to eliminate harmful toxic emissions that threaten environment. Its products include the Hydro Power Pak (HPP), a retrofit hydrogen insertion device for use on tractor trailer rigs, as well as on stationary diesel engines to enhance fuel economy, reduce harmful emissions, and enhance engine performance and horsepower; and Hydrogen Reactor under development to produce hydrogen on board to power a gasoline engine. Hypower Fuel's product portfolio also consists of an interface control module (ICM) to work in either a stand-alone application with an engine's fuel delivery system or in conjunction with the HPP under programming and testing stage for applications in the trucking industry. ICM's capabilities include enhanced horsepower rating, monitoring engine operations, data acquisition, and global positioning systems. The company also developed a manufacturing process to produce an organic diesel fuel lubrication additive, Bio-Lube, for enhancing lubricity to protect diesel fuel injectors and pumps; and replacing hydrocarbon two stroke oils to reduce harmful toxic emissions and provide enhanced lubrication.
