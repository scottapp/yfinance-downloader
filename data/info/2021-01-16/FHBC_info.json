  "longBusinessSummary": "CityXpress Corp supplies online auctions and online special sections to newspaper companies in the United States and Canada. Its online special section product integrates editorial content with advertising and promotional tools that make use of a newspaper's brand and traffic. The company's online auction product allows newspapers to auction advertising clients' products in exchange for advertising credits with the newspaper. Its XpressAuctions provides a package for the management and running of a newspaper's auction. The auction engine manages an auction when it is in progress, from managing bidder registrations to accepting bids and determining and posting leading bids. It also includes a marketing subsystem that, during the course of an online auction, provides bidders with messages encouraging them to continue bidding, and with bid confirmations that include coupons for vendors on whose products they have bid. A post-auction fulfillment system provides the newspaper with online and telephone facilities to collect bids and applicable taxes from the winning bidder. The fulfillment system also allows a newspaper to manage payments from credit cards to cash payments. Its XpressSections offers a group of stories and features related to the focus of the special section. The special section provides users with access related business profiles, a coupon flyer, and a shopping guide. The various pages of the special section also allow the sale and scheduling of large format, banner, and tile ads. The company's product line also includes XpressCoupons, XpressProfiles, XpressShoppingGuide, XpressStores, XpressKiosks/Web Brochures, and XpressExperts. Its competitors include A.M Stone/Auction Media, edeal Services Corp., Content That Works, and Publisher's Edge. CityXpress Corp was formerly known as CityXpress.com Corp. and changed its name to CityXpress Corp in November 2001. The company is based in Vancouver, Canada.",
