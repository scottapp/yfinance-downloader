It offers mobile service robots (MSRs) that automatically self-navigate homes or workplace. The company's products comprise GeckoNav, an automatic navigation control system based on fuzzy hybrid architecture; GeckoSuper that acts as the central hub through which GeckoSavants communicate with each other; GeckoScheduler that enables mobile robots to timely and repetitively remind the care receiver of various events; GeckoChat, a conversational artificial intelligence system that allows the user to verbally interact with those GSI systems, which have GeckoChat bilateral communication capability; and GeckoTrak, which merges and interprets data from sensor systems to achieve sensor fusion to automatically follow a designated person anywhere in the home. Its products also include GeckoSPIO, a robot controller circuit board that contains passive and active components; GeckoImager, which allows the system to process approximately 2,000 times more raw data than the CompoundedSensorArray system; GeckoOrient, which merges sensor data from odometry for enhanced orientation accuracy while errand running, patrolling, or following a designated person; GeckoSteer, a solution to address issues unique to the collision proof wheelchair; and GeckoMotorController that uses feedback from optical encoders to control wheel velocity. In addition, the company provides GeckoZap, a test, calibrate, and debug software suite; and CareBot MSR technology. GeckoSystems Intl. Corp. was founded in 1997 and is based in Conyers, Georgia.",
