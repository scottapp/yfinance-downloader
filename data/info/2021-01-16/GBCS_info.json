  "longBusinessSummary": "Global Healthcare REIT, Inc. (the ÂCompanyÂ or ÂGlobalÂ) was organized with the intent of operating as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for the purpose of investing in real estate and other assets related to the healthcare industry. The Company's focus has partially shifted from leasing nursing home assets to independent operators toward owning and operating its real estate assets itself. As a result, the Company no longer intends to elect to qualify as a REIT and is currently considering changing its name and other charter provisions to better reflect its current business model. Prior to the Company changing its name to Global Healthcare REIT, Inc. on September 30, 2013, the Company was known as Global Casinos, Inc. Global Casinos, Inc. operated two gaming casinos which were split-off and sold on September 30, 2013. Simultaneous with the split-off and sale of the gaming operations, the Company acquired West Paces Ferry Healthcare REIT, Inc. (WPF) in a transaction accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby WPF was deemed to be the accounting acquirer. The Company acquires, develops, leases, manages and disposes of healthcare real estate, and provides financing to healthcare providers. As of September 30, 2020, the Company owned twelve healthcare properties which are either leased or managed by third-party operators under triple-net operating terms or operated directly by the Company. The Company operates the facilities internally when advantageous and expedient.",
