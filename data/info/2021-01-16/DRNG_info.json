  "longBusinessSummary": "Drone Guarder, Inc., an early stage security and surveillance company, focuses on commercializing a drone enhanced home security system as a turnkey solution in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region. The company's DroneGuarder app-based solution includes a drone, infrared camera, and Android mobile app component that takes off from a wireless charging pad once an alarm has been triggered, records video for a few seconds, processes it, and sends an alert if a threat is found, which the DroneGuarder app sends in the form of a text, image, or short recorded video if supported by the GSM network. It intends to sell its solution directly to the clients, including homes, business, or security resellers. The company was formerly known as Vopia, Inc. and changed its name to Drone Guarder, Inc. in March 2017. The company was founded in 2012 and is based in London, the United Kingdom. Drone Guarder, Inc. is a subsidiary of Gimwork Project LP.",
