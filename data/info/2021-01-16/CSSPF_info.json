It operates through three segments: NIOX, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and LungFit. The company markets NIOX and NIOX VERO for use in asthma diagnosis and management; Tudorza for the treatment of COPD; and Duaklir, a fixed-dose combination of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist aclidinium bromide and long-acting beta agonist formoterol fumarate, which is administered twice-daily through the breath actuated Pressair inhaler for the maintenance treatment of COPD. It is also developing LungFit, a portable ventilator-compatible system that utilizes an electric voltage to produce precise quantities of nitric oxide from the nitrogen and oxygen in air. The company markets its products directly to specialists in the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Italy, and Germany, as well as through a network of partners internationally. Circassia Group Plc has a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to promote Tudorza and Duaklir for COPD treatment; and the United States and Chinese commercial rights to LungFit.
