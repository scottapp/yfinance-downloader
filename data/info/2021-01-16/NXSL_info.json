  "longBusinessSummary": "On february 22, 2011, NexTech FAS Technologies, Inc. went out of business as per its Chapter 11 liquidation filing under bankruptcy. NexTech FAS Technologies, Inc. engages in the design, manufacture, sale, and servicing of high-precision coating systems and advanced metrology and automation solutions for the semiconductor and flat panel display (FPD) industries. It also involves in the development FAS-Coat, a patented extrusion coating technology for aka spinless coating, slot die coating, and slit coating in the manufacturing process of FPD substrates. The company's products include Altair for testing the repeatability of systems that detect particles on the surface of substrates; Aludra, a reticle inspection system that employs light scattering technology to infer the presence of particles on a semiconductor reticle; Orion, a reticle inspection system, which provides inspection for semiconductor reticles and photomasks; FPDStar, an optical inspection system for identifying and mapping pattern, particle, and processing defects on FPD/TFT substrates; and NexTStar, an automated optical inspection system that represents breakthrough performance in FPD pattern, particle, and processing defect detection. Its products also comprise Pegasu, a wafer sorter series that provides standards-compliant user and automation interfaces; Proteus Reticle Load Port Upgrade kit, a hardware and software solution; and PST upgrades for wafer sorters. In addition, the company's FAS-Coat coating systems process substrates for the flat panel display, multi-chip module, solar cell, biomedical, and semiconductor industries. It was formerly known as NexTech Solutions, Inc. and changed its name to NexTech FAS Technologies, Inc. in July 2007. The company is headquartered in Austin, Texas.",
