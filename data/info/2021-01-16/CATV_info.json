It offers a suite of products comprising RF to Fiber (RF2F), a proprietary line of coax-to-fiber taps that enables cable operators to reach homes within their franchise authorized area; PowerMiser, a circuitry, which allows a low current 1 GHz amplifier and/or line extender to be constructed with a decrease in current power requirements; RF over Glass (RFoG) signal distribution technology that combines the existing cable TV infrastructure with fiber optics to reach the home; and Node+0 application, which combines the RFoG technology platform with its PowerMiser engineering to take fiber signal. The company also provides SOLAR-CATV that utilizes solar power and helps the operator extend service to areas not presently served without adding power sources; and Dynamically Scalable Return technology, which allows nodes, R-ONU's (RFoG optical network units) to adjust their return bandwidth by changing the channel lineup at the head end, as well as repair, testing, and upgrade services. It markets and sells its products through a network of dealers in the United States and Canada primarily to independent cable TV operators, as well as to multiple system operators. 4Cable TV International, Inc. was incorporated in 2007 and is based in Conway, South Carolina.",
