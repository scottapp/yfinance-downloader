  "longBusinessSummary": "ThermoEnergy Corporation is engaged in the commercialization of wastewater treatment systems and development of carbon reducing combustion technologies worldwide. The company offers wastewater treatment systems based on its controlled atmosphere separation technology (CAST) platform that includes water sourcing systems to treat brackish and natural water sources for use in societal and industrial processes; primary recovery systems to treat wastewater for reuse and concentrate the contaminants; final recovery systems to treat the remaining concentrate contaminants for disposal or additional processing to achieve zero liquid discharge; and compliance systems to meet local and federal regulatory mandates. The company's CAST products comprise Turbo CAST, a heat recuperation technology; and Mobile CAST, a self-contained wastewater processing system. It also offers ammonia recovery process, which captures ammonia from dilute waste streams and converts it into ammonium sulfate, a fertilizer for agricultural markets; Thermo ARP that is used with industrial, agricultural, and municipal anaerobic digesters; ThermoFuel Process, a renewable energy process that converts digested or waste-activated sewage sludge into a fuel that can be converted into electricity; and enhanced biogas production process, a method of processing and treating animal waste from animal farming. In addition, the company owns a patented pressurized oxycombustion technology, which converts fossil fuels and biomass into electricity while producing near zero air emissions, as well as removing and capturing carbon dioxide in liquid form. Its wastewater treatment systems are used in the metal finishing, heavy manufacturing, hydraulic fracturing, petrochemical, refining, aerospace, food and beverage processing, pulp and paper, microchip and circuit board manufacturing, and municipal wastewater applications. The company was founded in 1988 and is headquartered in Worcester, Massachusetts.",
