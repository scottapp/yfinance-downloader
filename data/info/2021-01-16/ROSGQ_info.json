  "longBusinessSummary": "Rosetta Genomics Ltd. operates as a genomic diagnostics company worldwide. The company's microRNA technologies based diagnostic tests include RosettaGX Cancer Origin for the identification of the primary site of metastatic cancer; mi-KIDNEY, a kidney tumor classification test for pathology samples; RosettaGX Reveal for the diagnosis of indeterminate thyroid fine-needle aspirate samples; and mi-LUNG diagnostic tests. It also provides UroVysion, a urine-based Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) assay that is intended for use in conjunction with and not in lieu of current standard diagnostic procedures, as an aid for initial diagnosis of bladder carcinoma in patients with hematuria and subsequent monitoring for tumor recurrence in patients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer; and ERG/PTEN, which are FISH-based prognostic tests in prostate cancer. In addition, the company offers ALK/ROS1 that are FISH-based predictive tests indicated for patients who are diagnosed with late stage lung cancer; and PCR gene mutation analysis for bladder, lung, colon, and melanoma patients. The company provides its diagnostic solutions for oncologists, urologists, endocrinologists, cytopathologists, and other specialists to facilitate them in serving their patients. It has a license agreement with Max Planck Innovation GmbH for the rights to its proprietary microRNAs for diagnostics and research purposes. The company also has a collaboration agreement with Meir Medical Center to develop a microRNA classifier relating to patients with non-small cell lung cancer considered for treatment with immuno oncology drugs. Rosetta Genomics Ltd. was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in Rehovot, Israel.",
