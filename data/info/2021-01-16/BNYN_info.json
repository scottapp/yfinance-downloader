It provides practice development training and assistance to chiropractors, as well as offers franchise support and related services to franchisees and licensees. The company also offers diagnostic testing services. Banyan Corporation provides nerve conduction velocity (NCV) testing to patients through health care professionals, such as doctors and chiropractors. The NCV testing measures the transmission of nerve impulses through the body, identifies problems in the nervous system, and enables to substantiate the cost of treatment to patients and their insurers. In addition, it manufactures and markets the VT3000, a nerve testing system for the diagnosis of neuropathies, which are diseases of the peripheral nerves and parts of the spine, as well as nerve irritation and other damage to the nervous system of a patient. The company was founded in 1978 and is based in Beverly Hills, California.",
