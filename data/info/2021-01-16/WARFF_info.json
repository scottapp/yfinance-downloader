  "longBusinessSummary": "Founded in 1886 with Hong Kong as its base, The Wharf (Holdings) Limited (Stock code: 0004) is the 17th company incorporated in Hong Kong and a premier company with a long history. As one of the 30 constituent stocks in the original Hang Seng Index since more than 50 years ago, Wharf is among the top local blue chips that is most actively traded and widely held. Backed by a long standing mission of ÂBuilding for TomorrowÂ and a proven track record in management and execution, the Group has produced consistent and productive performance over the years. Subsequent to the separate listing of Wharf Real Estate Investment Company Limited in November 2017 which focuses on its Hong Kong investment properties portfolio, The Wharf (Holdings) Limited's businesses are largely property-related, comprising Investment Properties, Hotels and Development Properties in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Other businesses include Logistics through Modern Terminals and Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals. Wharf's Peak Portfolio redefines the concept of luxury living with a collection of the rare and most prestigious residences, epitomising a unique and exclusive lifestyle at the most sought-after addresses in town. Besides the highly-acclaimed Mount Nicholson, other properties under development include 1 Plantation Road, 11 Plantation Road and 77 Peak Road. Besides The Peak Portfolio, the development pipeline of Hong Kong Properties also includes the Kowloon Tong Residential Project and projects in Kowloon East. In the Mainland, Wharf spearheads its investment properties with the International Finance Square (IFS) series at the very heart of CBD or new CBD in high potential cities including Changsha, Chengdu, Chongqing, Suzhou and Wuxi. IFS developments are positioned as trendsetting landmarks with unrivalled locations, superior planning and design, retailer and shopper critical mass, as well as top-notch retail management. Changsha IFS, 2018's newest to the collection, and Chengdu IFS opened in 2014 are comparable to Harbour City in Hong Kong in scale and prominence. The boutique Chongqing IFS, featuring the largest cluster of first-tier brands in Chongqing, was opened in 2017. The Group continues to adopt a selective land acquisition policy with strategic focus on key Tier 1 or 2 cities in order to secure high quality land bank with returns. The development property landbank at the end of June 2019 totalled 3.6 million square metres. Wharf Hotels manages an expanding portfolio of 17 hotels in Asia, spearheaded by a prominent Niccolo brand in recent years. The Wharf Hotels owns four contemporary, urban, chic Niccolo hotels (including The Murray, Hong Kong and Niccolo Changsha) and manages 13 Marco Polo hotels in Hong Kong, Mainland China and the Philippines. Niccolo Suzhou is the newest addition under development and is scheduled to open in 2021. The Group also owns and operates Modern Terminals and Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, key components in Hong Kong's success as a hub for international trade and international transportation for decades. CME2 is the Group's long-term investment, representing a strategic initiative of reinvesting capital and profit released from the CME1 exit in Hong Kong in a progressive new economy infrastructure CME2 arena that covers much larger markets with greater growth potential. ÂBuilding for TomorrowÂ also extends to Wharf's ÂBusiness-in-CommunityÂ (ÂBICÂ) pursuit. With the flagship school improvement programme ÂProject WecanÂ growing from strength to strength, the Group supports a series of BIC initiatives including Wu Zhi Qiao (Bridge to China) Charitable Foundation, Shanghai International Tower-running Grand Prix and Operation Panda with an aim of promoting BIC and to bring benefits to different segments of society.",
